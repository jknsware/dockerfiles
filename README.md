## A Repo to House All My Dockerfiles

Much easier to put all my Dockerfiles in one repo instead of scattered amongst all my projects.

Everything should be available at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jknsware/). If there's a problem with any image, please submit a PR.


## Technical

Example:

```
$ docker pull jknsware/<image>
```
